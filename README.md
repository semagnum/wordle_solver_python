# Wordle Solver

Assistant to help solve Wordle-like games.

## How to Use

1. Provide a dictionary (the script currently expects "dictionary.txt") - every possible word separated by new lines.
2. Run the module.
3. The intent is to use this while you are playing a Wordle-like game.
You give it the results the game provides, and the script will automatically filter out impossible words for you, enabling you to make better guesses.
